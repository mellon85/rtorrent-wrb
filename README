** Rtorrent web interface

Currently works with Ramaze Version 2009.02 (gem install ramaze -v 2009.02)

To start it install ramaze and in the folder ramaze-wrb do

ramaze start

Configuration files are saved in your home in .rtorrent-wrb.conf
If it does not exists then it is created with default values.


** Configure rtorrent

To use this web interface with rtorrent you must just add the line

scgi_local = /path/to/where/you/want/rtorrent.socket

in the rtorrent configuration file, and add that path as the configuration path in the web interface.
